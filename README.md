* Gem: <https://rubygems.org/gems/event_bus>
* API docs: <http://rubydoc.info/gems/event_bus/frames>
* Source code: <https://github.com/kevinrutherford/event_bus>

## Features

* Simple, global support for the Observer pattern, aka Publisher-Subscriber.
* Publish and subscribe to events throughout your Ruby application.
* Listen for events without coupling to the publishing object or class.
* Subscribe to events using names or regex patterns.
* Works with Rails.
* Works without Rails.
* Works with Sidekiq.

## Installation

Install the gem

```
gem install event_bus
```

Or add it to your Gemfile and run `bundle`.

``` ruby
gem 'event_bus'
```

## Usage

### Publishing events

Publish events whenever something significant happens in your application:

```ruby
class PlaceOrder
  //...
  EventBus.announce(:order_placed, order: current_order, customer: current_user)
end
```

### Publishing background events using sidekiq

Publish events whenever something significant happens in your application:

```ruby
class PlaceOrder
  //...
  EventBus.bg_announce(:order_placed, order: current_order, customer: current_user)
end
```

The event name (first argument) can be a String or a Symbol.
The Hash is optional and supplies a payload of information to any subscribers.

(If you don't like the method name `announce` you can use `publish` or
`broadcast` instead.)
(If you don't like the method name `bg_announce` you can use `bg_publish` or
`bg_broadcast` instead

### Subscribing to events

There are three ways to subscribe to events.

1. Subscribe a listener object:

    ```ruby
    EventBus.subscribe(StatsRecorder.new)
    ```

    The event will be handled by a method whose name matches the event name:

    ```ruby
    class StatsRecorder
      def order_placed(payload)
        order = payload[:order]
        //...
      end
    end
    ```

    If the object has no matching method, it doesn't receive the event.

2. Specify the method to be called when the event fires:

    ```ruby
    EventBus.subscribe(:order_placed, StatsRecorder.new, :print_order)
    ```

    In this case the event will be handled by the `print_order` method:

    ```ruby
    class StatsRecorder
      def print_order(payload)
        order = payload[:order]
        //...
      end
    end
    ```

    The first argument to `subscribe` can be a String,
    a Symbol or a Regexp:

    ```ruby
    EventBus.subscribe(/order/, StatsRecorder.new, :print_order)
    ```

3. Subscribe a block:

    ```ruby
    EventBus.subscribe(:order_placed) do |payload|
      order = payload[:order]
      //...
    end
    ```

    The argument to `subscribe` can be a String, a Symbol or a Regexp:

    ```ruby
    EventBus.subscribe(/order/) do |payload|
      order = payload[:order]
      //...
    end
    ```

#### Subscribe to background published events

due to a limitation using [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq),
you can not subscribe to events published using `bg_announce` using Symbols in either `event_name` or `payload`.
you can via Reqexp, Strings or listener objects.


```ruby
EventBus.subscribe('order_placed', StatsRecorder.new, :print_order)
```

```ruby
EventBus.subscribe('order_placed') do |payload|
order = payload['order']
//...
end
```

See the specs for more detailed usage scenarios.
